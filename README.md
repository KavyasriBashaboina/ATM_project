# ATM_project
The program will simulate basic ATM functionality, including account balance checking, deposits, and withdrawals.
How the Program Works:
When the program starts, it displays a menu with options.
The user selects an option by entering a number.
Depending on the user's choice, the corresponding ATM function (check balance, deposit, withdraw) is executed.
The program repeats until the user selects the "Exit" option.

Example Output:

Welcome to the ATM!
1. Check Balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Exit
Choose an option: 2
Enter amount to deposit: 100
Deposited: $100.0

Welcome to the ATM!
1. Check Balance
2. Deposit
3. Withdraw
4. Exit
Choose an option: 1
Your current balance is: $100.0
This is a simple implementation, and you can extend it further by adding features like PIN authentication, transaction history, etc.
